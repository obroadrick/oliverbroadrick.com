            <h4>Image stitching</h4>
            <p>
            An image is like a projection of many 3D rays 
            of light onto a 2D plane.
            Two images taken from the same location but with the
            camera pointing in different directions may capture some
            of the same rays, but simply overlaying
            the two images won't succesfully align them since
            the different perspectives distort things. 
            With cool linear algebra, we can
            find a way to map the coordinates between such images
            so that they can be combined to show a wider
            field of view than any one of them showed alone. 
            In this project I capture multiple images from one viewpoint
            and create such an image stitching.
            </p>
            <h4>Note on the idea of a homography</h4>
            <p>
            A homography is a map from one projective space to another.
            In the context of images, the world is a 3D vector space,
            and two images are 2D projective spaces. To map the 
            coordinates of one image to the other, we use a homography.
            While the details of the linear algebra are interesting (very),
            they are beyond the scope of this report. I implemented the
            linear algebra for finding homographies 
            myself (my bell/whistle), and it was quite fun to do so. 
            In particular, I wrote code to solve the exact system
            (four correspondences) and to solve the overdetermined
            system (by minimizing square differences).
            </p>
            <h4>Initial two-image stitching</h4>
            <p>
            Now that I can find the homography to map pixels in one
            image to pixels in the other, I can begin creating image stitchings.
            I start with a couple of images I took sitting at a table
            eating lunch a few days ago.
            <p>
            <img src="mosaics/left.jpg" width="300" alt="Left image raw">
            <img src="mosaics/right.jpg" width="300" alt="Right image raw">
            </p>
            I can extend the left-hand
            image by adding
            new columns at the right-hand side that get pixel values
            from the right-hand images by mapping the coordinates over.
            I used an interface on my laptop
            to click on the images to get their coorespondences.
            to find the homography.
            I began by finding just four correspondences, which worked, 
            but I wanted to test that my minimization code worked too, 
            and so I added a fifth point. The alignment got slightly
            better with the fifth point, but not much. Here is that 
            result.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="mosaics/first-stitch-full.png" width="600" alt="First full stitch">
            </p>
            <p>
            This is a satisfying result after writing out the code
            to solve the linear system. That said, it is misaligned.
            Look at the table. The napkin. The math is clearly doing
            what it's supposed to, so I blame my clicking precision.
            I'm not much of a clicker, apparently.
            While I'll admit that I did spend a bunch of time trying to get
            really precise clicks, I know that lazy, low-pressure 
            clicking followed by automatic
            correction/optimization will be much nicer in the long run.
            </p>
            <h4>Automatically improved correspondences</h4>
            <p>
            I use a basic solution to this problem. For each corresponding
            point, I search within a small radius (~10 pixels) and find
            the point which minimizes the sum of the differences squared
            of the pixels within that same radius.
            This way my clicks can be off by a bit, but the homography
            will still be based on the intended correspondences that I 
            had in mind.
            A bit of a balancing act is performed here. 
            These patches of pixels
            within the radius shouldn't really be the same in the two
            images (if they were, no homography is needed: the images 
            are already aligned perfectly). This means that the optimization
            might not always work, but, by keeping the radius small, it is
            more likely that the patches will line up even for 
            significantly warped images.
            This method imediately improved the results.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="mosaics/align-search-stitch-full.png" width="600" alt="First aligned full stitch">
            </p>
            <p>
            Now the results are getting seriously satisfying. That is a 
            well-aligned table. And, in future images, I won't have to
            worry as much about my click precision.
            That said, the transition is still a bit harsh. It is
            especially noticable up at the top on the wall where the
            lighting is different in the two images. I'm guessing
            my phone 'corrected' for lighting automatically, leading
            to this difference.
            </p>
            <h4>Smoother transitions</h4>
            <p>
            An easy way to ease this transition without actually
            thinking about lighting at all is to have a gradient
            from one image to the next wherever the images overlap.
            I'll use a weighted average where the weights are
            high for an image on its side of the overlap and low 
            out at its boundary.
            Specifically, I'll assign weights for each row of the
            stitching by finding
            the width of the overlap and having the weights be 
            linear from 0 to 1 throughout that overlap.
            Here is the two-image stitching with that transition.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="mosaics/transition-wow.png" width="600" alt="Images with transition">
            </p>
            <p>
            I am pleased with this result. Artificats of the stitching 
            process are more subtle now. In the transition area, you
            can find little fuzzy double edges where things aren't quite
            aligned and the averaging is showing both images.
            That said, this is certainly the best result so far.
            And don't be fooled by the shadows! 
            There is a line on the table from the
            sunlight/shadow, but that line is not
            from the stitching process. 
            The rightmost overlapping column in the 
            stitching is actually dozens of pixels to the left of that line
            (check the previous images if you don't believe me).
            <h4>Rectifying images</h4>
            Here I'll take a short break from stitching in order to show
            another use of a homography. We can map points in an
            image not to another image's plane but instead to some
            points that give a desired property (shape).
            An example will make this clearer.
            I hate when I'm sitting off to one side in a classroom, and
            I take a picture of the whiteboard to supplement my notes.
            Of course the picture is all distorted and annoying to 
            read because of the angle. Well, a quick homography 
            solves this problem. Here's an image of some trig on
            a whiteboard.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="mosaics/torectify.jpg" width="200" alt="To rectify">
            <img src="mosaics/zoomtorectify.jpg" width="400" alt="Zoomed in to rectify">
            </p>
            Now, I clicked to find the coordinates of the four corners
            of the whiteboard, and I then chose coordinates of a perfect
            rectangle and treated them as the correspondences.
            The resulting homography gives us a straight-on perspective
            of the trig!
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="mosaics/rectified.png" width="200" alt="Rectified">
            <img src="mosaics/zoomrectified.png" width="400" alt="Zoomed in rectified">
            </p>
            <p>
            This is really quite a satisfying exercise, and a nice
            application of this image warping.
            This rectifying isn't the focus of this work really,
            but it's too tempting to not try to push this to a limit.
            Here's another image that I took of that same white board
            on another day. It's really difficult to read the writing
            at all in this image because it was taken at such a steep 
            angle.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="mosaics/steep.jpg" width="200" alt="Steep">
            <img src="mosaics/zoomsteep.jpg" width="400" alt="Zoomed steep">
            </p>
            <p>
            The same process as before yields the following result.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="mosaics/rectifiedsteep.png" width="200" alt="Steep rectified">
            <img src="mosaics/zoomrectifiedsteep.png" width="400" alt="Zoomed steep rectified">
            </p>
            <p>
            Come on. That's cool.
            </p>
            <p>
            There is something interesting here. 
            I wonder whether finding a homography to re-project 
            text makes it more readable not just for humans but
            for machine learning models. Maybe a self-driving vehicle
            could read road signs more accurately if it made use of 
            this image rectificaiton with a homography.
            It also makes me wonder if we should be rectifying 
            recorded lectures... I don't love watching algebra
            recordings with distorted writing.
            </p>

            <h4>New images</h4>
            Back to mosaicing.
            So far, I've let the two images from lunch
            dictate my workflow by
            motivating each subsequent improvement.
            Now, I'm pretty happy with the mosaic I've made from these
            two, and it's time to move on to different images.
            In order to make the whole process a single pipeline, 
            I'll take one final step of writing a nice little function
            that will take a bunch of images as input and create their
            mosaic.
            At risk of of boring you, I'll just show that function 
            (in Python) to remind you of the several steps I'm taking
            to make my mosaics.
            </p>
            -->
            <h4>Bit of code</h4>
            <p>At one point I had ambitions of interesting
            photos other than my lunch 
            (which there is still some small chance I 
            do before these are looked at...), but at this point
            I will now just add a code snippet to wrap up.
            <P>
            Because it occured to me that I'm fulfilling some
            of the requirements of this project by implementing
            that homography computation myself, I figured I should
            show it. Here is my function for that.
