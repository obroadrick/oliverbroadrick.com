            <h4>Image mosaicing</h4>
            <p>
            An image is like a projection of 3D rays onto a 2D plane.
            Two images taken from the same point but with the
            camera pointing in different directions may capture some
            of the same rays. With cool linear algebra, we can
            find a way to map the coordinates between such images.
            Then images can be combined to show a wider
            field of view than any one of them showed alone. 
            In this project I capture multiple images from one viewpoint
            and such an image mosaic.
            </p>
            <h4>Homography</h4>
            <p>
            I need to think more still about how I want to explain
            this cool math.
            </p>
            <h4>Initial two-image mosaicing</h4>
            <p>
            Now that I can find the homography to map pixels in one
            image to pixels in the other, I can begin creating image mosaics.
            I start with a couple of images I took sitting at a table
            eating lunch a few days ago.
            <p>
            <img src="mosaics/left.jpg" width="300" alt="Left image raw">
            <img src="mosaics/right.jpg" width="300" alt="Right image raw">
            </p>
            I can extend the left-hand
            image by adding
            new columns at the right-hand side that get pixel values
            from the right-hand images by mapping the coordinates over.
            I used an interface on my laptop
            to click on the images to get their coorespondences.
            to find the homography.
            I began by finding just four correspondences, which worked, 
            but I wanted to test that my minimization code worked too, 
            and so I added a fifth point. The alignment got slightly
            better with the fifth point, but not much. Here is that 
            result.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="mosaics/first-stitch-full.png" width="600" alt="First full stitch">
            </p>
            <p>
            This is a satisfying result after writing out the code
            to solve the linear system. That said, it is misaligned.
            Look at the table. The napkin. The math is clearly doing
            what it's supposed to, so I blame my clicking precision.
            I'm not much of a clicker, apparently.
            While I'll admit that I did spend a bunch of time trying to get
            really precise clicks, I know that lazy, low-pressure 
            clicking followed by automatic
            correction/optimization will be much nicer in the long run.
            </p>
            <h4>Automatically improved correspondences</h4>
            <p>
            I use a basic solution to this problem. For each corresponding
            point, I search within a small radius (~10 pixels) and find
            the point which minimizes the sum of the differences squared
            of the pixels within that same radius.
            This way my clicks can be off by a bit, but the homography
            will still be based on the intended correspondences that I 
            had in mind.
            A bit of a balancing act is performed here. 
            These patches of pixels
            within the radius shouldn't really be the same in the two
            images (if they were, no homography is needed: the images 
            are already aligned perfectly). This means that the optimization
            might not always work, but, by keeping the radius small, it is
            more likely that the patches will line up even for 
            significantly warped images.
            This method imediately improved the results.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="mosaics/align-search-stitch-full.png" width="600" alt="First aligned full stitch">
            </p>
            <p>
            Now the results are getting seriously satisfying. That is a 
            well-aligned table. And, in future images, I won't have to
            worry as much about my click precision.
            That said, the transition is still a bit harsh. It is
            especially noticable up at the top on the wall where the
            lighting is different in the two images. I'm guessing
            my phone 'corrected' for lighting automatically, leading
            to this difference.
            </p>
            <h4>Smoother transitions</h4>
            <p>
            An easy way to ease this transition without actually
            thinking about lighting at all is to have a gradient
            from one image to the next where each pixel in the mosaic
            that has data from both images (i.e. the images overlap there)
            can be a weighted average where the weights are
            high for an image when the point is nearer that image.
            I'll assign the weights for each row of pixels by finding
            the width of the overlap and having the weights be 
            linear from 0 to 1 throughout that overlap.
            Here is the two-image mosaic with that transition.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="mosaics/transition-wow.png" width="600" alt="Images with transition">
            </p>
            <p>
            I am terribly pleased with this result. I can't really find
            artifacts of the mosaicing process. Maybe I'm missing them?
            Don't be fooled! There is a line on the table form the
            sunlight to shadow of the window, but that line is not
            from the mosaicing. The right most overlapping column in the 
            mosaic is actually dozens of pixels to the left of that line
            (check the previous images if you don't believe me).
            <h4>New images</h4>
            So far, I've let these two images dictate my workflow by
            motivating each subsequent improvement.
            Now, I'm totally happy with the mosaic I've made from these
            two, and it's time to move on to different images.
            In order to make the whole process a single pipeline, 
            I'll take one final step of writing a nice little function
            that will take a bunch of images as input and create their
            mosaic.
            At risk of of boring you, I'll just show that function 
            (in Python) to remind you of the several steps I'm taking
            to make my mosaics.
