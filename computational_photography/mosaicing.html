            <h4>Image mosaicing</h4>
            <p>
            An image is like a projection of 3D rays onto a 2D plane.
            Two images from the same viewpoint but taken with the 
            camera pointing in different directions may capture some
            of the same rays. With cool linear algebra, we can
            find a way to map the coordinates of image to the coordinates
            of the other so that a combined image can be formed.
            In this project I capture multiple images from one viewpoint
            and create an image mosaic
            that extends the field of view to show them all in one image.
            </p>
            <h4>Homography</h4>
            <p>
            I need to think more still about how I want to explain
            this cool math.
            </p>
            <h4>Initial two-image mosaicing</h4>
            <p>
            Now that I can find the homography to map pixels in one
            image to pixels in the other, I can extend a left-hand
            image by adding
            new columns at the right-hand side that get pixel data
            from the right-hand image.
            To begin, I used an interface on my laptop
            to click on points on the images to get their coordinates
            to be used as the correspondences to find the homography.
            I began by finding just four correspondences which worked, 
            but I wanted to test that my minimization code worked too, 
            and so I added a fifth point. The alignment got slightly
            better with the fifth point, but not much. Here is the 
            result.

            <h4>Automaticly improved correspondences</h4>
            <p>
            This is a satisfying result after writing out the code
            to solve the linear system. That said, it is clearly misaligned.
            Look at the table. The napkin. The math is clearly doing
            what it's supposed to, so I blame my clicking precision.
            While I'll admit that I did spend a bunch of time trying to get
            really precise clicks, I know that lazy clicking and automatic
            correction will be much nicer in the long run.
            I take a basic solution to this problem. For each corresponding
            point, I search within a small radius (~10 pixels) and find
            the point which minimizes the sum of the differences squared
            of the pixels within that same radius around each 
            candidate point.
            This imediately gave better results.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
            Now the results are getting seriously satisfying. That is a 
            well-aligned table. And, in future images, I won't have to
            worry as much about my click precision.
