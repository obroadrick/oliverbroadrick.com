            <h4>Image mosaics</h4>
            <p>
            If you have many images, they can be arranged into a grid such that a newer, bigger image emerges.
            Practically, creating such an image mosaic consists of a desired bigger image, and a dataset of many images. Breaking the bigger image into patches, each patch can be matched to a similar image in the dataset. 
            Given a meaningful bigger image and related dataset of images, the results can be compelling.
            My goal in this project was to create an image mosaic for the GW Computer Science Department. 
            </p>
            <h4>Making image mosaics</h4>
            <p>
            The code is rather simple. The desired big image is broken into many 'patches' (I made mine 16 pixels by 16 pixels), and then the dataset of images is searched over. I made a duplicate dataset of just the 16x16 images as vectors, so that the distance computations were a bit quicker, and from there it is just a matter of minimizing the distance from each desired (big image) patch to an image from the dataset.
            I didn't allow a dataset image to be used more than once (that would be lame), and so the order in which the patches are filled in affects the results, especially when dealing with a smaller dataset. Thus, I filled in the patches from the center outwards, as opposed to the more natural left to right, up to down ordering.

            </p>
            <h4>Building a dataset</h4>
            <p>
            Scraping Twitter, Instagram, etc was my first thought, but it turns out they don't make it easy to get images in bulk (I'm not the first to have tried...).
            Google images, however, are quite easy to scrape, and Fair Use is Fair Use.
            I started by scraping the first few pages of results from queries like "GW Computer Science", "GW Campus", and "GW RD Showcase".
            The resulting images had a terrible mix of duplicates, unrelated contents, and papers/banners/graphics that didn't look good in a mosaic. Frankly, I just spent an hour or two removing them by hand rather quickly and haphazardly.
            </p>
            <p>TODO Here's what that looked like</p>
            Then, I added some images by hand from various CS Professor's website, lab webpages, and the CS Department website. 
            Finally, I took several dozen images with my phone in and around SEH.
