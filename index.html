            <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>
                My research interests are still forming, but I like thinking mathematically, 
                and I've particularly enjoyed working on projects that have social impact.
            <h5>Statistical Election Audits</h5>
            <p>
                Since 2020 I've been a member of 
                <a href="https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~poorvi/">Professor Poorvi Vora</a>'s
                research group on risk-limiting audits (RLAs), rigorous statistical procedures
                used to detect errors in election results.
                We developed PROVIDENCE, the most efficient and secure ballot polling RLA known today.
                I wrote the proof that PROVIDENCE is risk-limiting, 
                designed and conducted simulation experiments,
                implemented it in
                <a href="https://github.com/gwexploratoryaudits/r2b2">open source RLA software</a>,
                and participated in its pilot use by the US State of Rhode Island, described in 
                <a href="https://www.ri.gov/press/view/43054">their press release</a>.
                I presented <a href="/posters/audits_poster.pdf">a poster</a> at the 2022 GW SEAS 
                R+D Showcase.
                Preprints and publications are given below, and an additional manuscript is in preparation.

            <h5>Glitter</h5>
            <p>
            Hold a sheet of a glitter to light and enjoy the sparkles. Move it just slightly, and a whole new sparkle pattern emerges! This high sensitivity of appearance to pose gives glitter sheets strong potential as a cheap target for single image camera calibration. Since Summer 2022, I've been working with <a href="https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~pless/">Professor Robert Pless</a> and peer <a href="https://github.com/adellari">Addy Irankunda</a> on this problem. I've made a few blogs posts about it:

            <h5>Scheduling</h5>
            <p>
                I designed and analyzed scheduling algorithms using the imprecise computation model for a project on real-time AI at the edge. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/obroadrick/imprecise">software</a>, and our submission is given below.
