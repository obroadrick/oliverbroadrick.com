            <p>
                I am a senior undergraduate student studying computer science 
                and math at 
                <a href="https://www.seas.gwu.edu/">George Washington University</a>. 
                I'm also a proud member of
                <a href="https://www.gwmensrowing.com/">GW Men's Rowing</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Here is <a href="https://obroadrick.github.io/cv/cv.pdf">my CV</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>
                My research interests are broad and forming. I like thinking mathematically, 
                and I've particularly enjoyed working on projects that have social impact.
            </p>
            <h5>Statistical Election Audits</h5>
            <p>
                Since 2020 I've been working on a team led by 
                <a href="https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~poorvi/">Professor Poorvi Vora</a>
                on statistical risk-limiting audits (RLAs)
                which validate election results within rigorous error bounds.
                I've enjoyed working on both the theory and implementation, contributing to our
                <a href="https://github.com/gwexploratoryaudits/r2b2">open source audit software</a>.
                My first paper will appear shortly in 
                <a href="https://fc22.ifca.ai/workshops.html">Voting '22</a>, 
                and additional manuscripts presenting novel audits and 
                related results are currently being drafted.

            </p>
            <h5>Scheduling</h5>
            <p>
                I am working with
                <a href="https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~narahari/">Professor Bhagi Narahari</a> 
                to develop a scheduling algorithm for neural network tasks using an imprecise computation model. 
                I will report results here.
            </p>
            <h5>Hotel Recognition</h5>
            <p>
                Human trafficking cases often have images from hotel rooms
                as evidence.
                A group led by <a href="https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~pless/">Professor Robert Pless</a>
                has already compiled a database of millions of hotel room images
                and developed the tool Traffickcam that can be used to 
                match query images to specific hotel and hotel chains.
                The National Center for Missing
                and Exploited Children (NCMEC) uses Traffickcam as it is, but 
                there is room for improvement.
                The current version computes a single descriptor of the query image to compare to those in the database.
                This descriptor could miss high resolution details in the image that
                are useful for hotel recognition.
                With a group of other CS seniors, I'm working 
                on a new version of Traffickcam that uses key points
                for matching instead.

            <h4>Teaching</h4>
            <p>
                I love helping folks learn.
                I have been tutoring math, physics, and computer science since I was in high school.
                Since then I have tutored for the

                and I currently tutor high school students for a 
                <a href="https://www.tungstenprep.com/">local Washington, DC
                    company.</a>
